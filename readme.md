# NFT Marketplace on Bitlink Chain
Welcome to the NFT Marketplace repository on Bitlink Chain! This repository aims to guide developers in creating a fully decentralized NFT marketplace on Bitlink Chain, enabling users to buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets in a secure and transparent manner.

## Overview
The NFT marketplace on Bitlink Chain allows users to create, mint, buy, and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of digital or physical items, art, collectibles, music, and more. This marketplace will enable artists, creators, and collectors to showcase and monetize their unique creations.

## Smart Contract Functions
The smart contract for the NFT marketplace should include the following essential functions:

1. **Mint NFT:** Allows creators to mint new NFTs by specifying metadata, such as name, description, image, and attributes.

2. **Buy NFT:** Enables users to purchase NFTs from the marketplace using BTLK tokens or other supported tokens.

3. **List NFT for Sale:** Allows NFT owners to list their tokens for sale on the marketplace, along with the desired price.

4. **Cancel NFT Listing:** Enables NFT owners to remove their tokens from the marketplace if they no longer wish to sell them.

5. **Transfer NFT:** Allows users to transfer ownership of their NFTs to other addresses on the blockchain.

6. **Get NFT Details:** Provides a function to retrieve the details of a specific NFT, including metadata, owner, and current price.
